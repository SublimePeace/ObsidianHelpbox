### Instructions:
1) Navigate to your Obsidian vault's snippets folder in -> <vaultname>/.obsidian/snippets
2) Make a "CalloutsAndCheckboxesReminder.css" file and copy paste the code in it, then enable the snippet in Settings->Appearance->CSS snippets

##### Please Note:
You may not be able to use the custom checkboxes displayed in the cheatsheet unless you are using a theme that utlizes them. If you do use a theme that uses custom checkboxes, they may not be enabled by default and may need to be toggled on in the Style Settings community plugin's menu.
